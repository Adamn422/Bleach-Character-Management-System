# Bleach-Character-Management-System

The "Bleach Character Management System" is a Python-based project that allows users to manage and interact with a database of characters from the popular anime series "Bleach." The system provides functionalities to add, edit, delete, and view characters.

Features:

Load Data: The system loads the character data from a CSV file, 'characters.csv', into a pandas DataFrame.

Add Character: Users can add new characters to the database by providing the character's name, role, and abilities. The new character is appended to the DataFrame and saved to the CSV file.

Edit Character: Users can modify the role and abilities of an existing character. If the character is not found in the database, it is added as a new character.

Delete Character: Users can remove a character from the database by providing the character's name. The updated DataFrame is saved to the CSV file.

View All Characters: Users can view the entire database, displaying all the characters and their respective details.
